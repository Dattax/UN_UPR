# UN_UPR

## Project Overview

The UN_UPR project is an initiative developed for the United Nations Universal Periodic Review (UPR) under the auspices of CodeAlliance, a program of Benetech. This project aims to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of data management and analysis related to the UPR process.

The UPR is a unique process which involves a review of the human rights records of all UN Member States. It provides an opportunity for each state to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to fulfill their human rights obligations.

The structure of the UN_UPR project includes:
- **Data Collection Module:** For gathering and structuring data from various sources.
- **Analysis Module:** Tools and algorithms to analyze the collected data.
- **Reporting Module:** For generating reports that can be used by stakeholders to make informed decisions.
